## Commit and release

- Conventional commits are appreciated (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`)
- Use Changesets for versioning:
  - `pnpm changeset` to add a changeset
  - `pnpm version-packages` to bump versions
  - `pnpm publish-packages` to publish

## Pull requests

- Include tests for changes
- Update docs/README when API changes
- Keep diffs focused and small when possible

## Code style

- TypeScript strict, avoid `any`
- Prefer explicit names and early returns
